# scavenger
A Windows Application for the automated provisioning of a Vultr VPS using an Ansible Playbook.

## Set API Key
In Scavenger.UI you will find a Example.Settings.settings file. This file should be renamed to Settings.settings, as it will not be tracked by version control. You can add your own Vultr API Key to the value of APIKEY. I recommend using Visual Studio's designer view for this action.
